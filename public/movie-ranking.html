<h1>Matthew's Top Three Films of All Time</h1>
<hr />
<h2>The Godfather (1972)</h3>
<h3>Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather is one of the few examples of media that is nearly perfect. The characters are incredibly well-written and despite their criminal occupations the viewer still feels an immense amount of emotional connection to them. The story is captivating and the cinematography captures the 1970s mafia aesthetic very well.</h3>
<h2>The Shawshank Redemption (1994)</h2>
<h3>This movie, based on Stephen King's fictional story of the same name, is frequently revered as one of the best films of all time for a reason. It has one of the best stories ever told in a movie with excellent characters, twists, and a satisfying conclusion.</h3>
<h2>Rear Window (1954)</h2>
<h3>This classic Hitchcock thriller knows how to make a lot out of a little. It is suspenseful and captivating despite taking place entirely in the confines of a single room. It remains to this day one of his most crtically acclaimed works.</h3>
